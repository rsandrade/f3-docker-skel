# f3-docker-skel

Fatfree Framework 3.6 + Docker skel and devel environment

**Require**

    Was tested in Ubuntu 16.04 with the following packages installed:
    - Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/)
    - Composer (apt-get install composer)
    - Git (apt-get install git)

**Commands**

    Build and run 
    $ git clone https://github.com/rsandrade/f3-docker-skel.git
    $ cd f3-docker-skel
    $ sh build-run.sh
    
    Go to http://localhost/ to run your project in a devel environment

**What you can do with it**

    You dont need to stop the "build and run" script to change files in your project
    Run it and just start to write code and run/test it using a browser
